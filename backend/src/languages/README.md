# Profanity.\*.txt

Contains a list of profane words in each language, used to remove them from text.
The list is taken from [this repository](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/), which Shutterstock uses to filter image search terms.

We've removed a few terms from the list that are unoffensive in text.
Some of these terms may give bad image results, but are fine for a text system.
